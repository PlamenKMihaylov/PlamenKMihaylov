# 👋 Hi, I'm Plamen Mihaylov

I'm a freelance web developer working with **WordPress**, **WooCommerce**, and custom-built solutions, currently transitioning into full-stack **JavaScript development**.  
My main focus is on **React**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and scalable frontend architecture.

I'm also completing my final year in **Economics** at Sofia University and studying software engineering at **Telerik Academy Alpha JavaScript**.

I enjoy solving algorithmic problems, building real-world applications, and optimizing e-commerce performance across different platforms.
